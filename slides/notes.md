## Collective Oscillations

1. P29:

Suppose we have some neutrinos going through a dense neutrino background. Those neutrinos will interact with the background neutrinos and experience a potential.

The Hamiltonian for the potential can be written down in this way. This potential is proportional to the number density of the background neutrinos and is also related to the flavor states of the background neutrinos.

We can also write down the Hamiltonian in flavor isospin space. It's in the opposite direction of the flavor isospin of the background neutrinos.

Here in this figure we have got a neutrino self interaction $H_{\nu\nu}$ due to the background. The neutrinos going through the region will precess around $H_{\nu\nu}$.

The complexity of the problem is that the states of background neutrinos will also evolve due to the incoming neutrinos. So the neutrinos are coupled with each other and it's not a linear problem anymore.
