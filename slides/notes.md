## Intro

Thank you everyone for coming to my defense talk, especially everyone on my committee, Prof. Allahverdi, Prof. Finley, Prof. Loomba, Prof. Qian from University of Minnesota, and my advisor Prof. Duan.

There will be three sections in my talk. The first section is a breif introduction of neutrino oscillations. Then I will talk about neutrino oscillations in matter as well as collective neutrino oscillations.



## Neutrino Oscillations

1. P2


The mass differences are very different which corresponds to different oscillation scales. We can focus on two flavor senario.

There is a famous effect called MSW effect. For electron neutrinos produced in a stellar core, they will experience a huge potential due to the dense matter. The total Hamiltonian is almost poiting downward. Electron neutrinos barely precess and no neutrino flavor conversion is possible. However neutrinos propagate through out will experience lower matter density and the density change is not too dramatic. In this case the flavor isospin will follow the change of Hamiltonian. We can see some flavor change. As the neutrinos reach the surface, the Hamiltonian becomes Vacuum Hamiltonian and electron flavor neutrinos are partially converted.

4. P14

Here is a simple example why it is important.

Suppose we have a constant matter density, and neutrinos are starting from one of the mass states. Since the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in mass basis, there will be no transition to the other mass state.

However, if we add a periodic component to it. 







## Collective Oscillations

1. P29:

Suppose we have some neutrinos going through a dense neutrino background. Those neutrinos will interact with the background neutrinos and experience a potential.

The Hamiltonian for the potential can be written down in this way. This potential is proportional to the number density of the background neutrinos and is also related to the flavor states of the background neutrinos.

We can also write down the Hamiltonian in flavor isospin space. It's in the opposite direction of the flavor isospin of the background neutrinos.

Here in this figure we have got a neutrino self interaction $H_{\nu\nu}$ due to the background. The neutrinos going through the region will precess around $H_{\nu\nu}$.

The complexity of the problem is that the states of background neutrinos will also evolve due to the incoming neutrinos. So the neutrinos are coupled with each other and it's not a linear problem anymore.

4. P30

Before we move on to a specific problem. We can qualitatively determine whether neutrino selfinteractions can lead to different oscillations. Apart from the fact that it's nonlinear, we can estimate the energy scales of the problem which corresponds to the scale of the flavor change.

We have the vacuum oscillations frequency, and a neutrino self interaction potential.

The vacuum oscillation frequency can be estimated. It corresponds to oscillations on the scale of kms or tens of kms for 1MeV neutrinos.


2. P31

I will explain the phenomenon using two-beam model. In this model, neutrinos are emitted from a infinite line and the emission is translational symmetric. At each point, we have two emission angles, the first beam emits neutrinos and the other beam emits antineutrinos. I also choose the angles so that the emission is left right symmetry. Because we are more interested in neutrino selfinteractions, I am setting the vacuum mixing angle to be 0.

The vacuum part of the Hamiltonian for the first beam is basically what we have seen before. But for the antineutrinos, it's effectively the term with the opposite frequency. The neutrino self interaction is proportional to the states of the beams. And I defined the coefficients to be proportional to the number density of the corresponding beams and a geometric factor. The geometric factor is related to the emission directions. And mu is a constant.

3. P32

We could solve this problem numerically. Here is an example for $nu=5\omega_v$ and inverted hierarchy.

On the left I am showing you the polarization vectors, and on the right we have the probability to be electron flavor. I prepared both of the beams to be electron flavor with a tiny perturbation. For neutrinos the flavor isospin is pointing upward, but for antineutrinos it's pointing downward by definition.

In the beginning, they will start to deviate from electron flavor very slowly. At some point, neutrinos and antineutrinos are converted partially to the other flavor. But it will come back to electron flavor quickly. It will repeat itself.
