\section{Neutrino Flavor Conversions and Dispersion Relation}

In 2017, Izaguirre, Reffelt, and Tamborra published a paper discussing the relations between flavor instabilities and dispersion relation. They considered a two flavor sinario of neutrino oscillations and worked out the dispersion relation between the collective oscillation frequency $\omega$ and wave vector $\vec k$. They identified the possible correlation between instabilities and gaps, that the gaps of $\omega$ in dispersion relations .
